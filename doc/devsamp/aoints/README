These code examples, written in C++, C, and Fortran 90, demonstrate how to use MPQC to compute molecular integrals in Gaussian bases.

1) To compile these examples you must have compiled MPQC and installed it using 'make install'
   commmand. This will install the code examples under $prefix/doc/share/mpqc-${version}/examples directory, where $prefix is the
   installation prefix provided to configure script during configuration of MPQC
   (the default is /usr/local/mpqc/$mpqcversion).
2) To compile the C++ example simply type 'make', this will create an executable file called 'aoints'. To run it simply type './aoints'.
3) To compile the C example type 'make c_aoints'. To run the resulting executable type './c_aoints'.
4) To compile the F90 example type 'make f90_aoints'. Note that by default the compilation will be attempted with the same
   Fortran compiler that was used to compile the lone F77 source file in MPQC. Since many modern Fortran compilers default to F90,
   this should work fine. If you want to specify a different Fortran compiler to compile this example, do so by typing
   'make F90=path_to_a_f90_compiler F90FLAGS="extra_f90_compiler_flags" f90_aoints'. To run the resulting executable, type './f90_aoints'.
