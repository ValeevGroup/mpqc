This code example, written in C++, demonstrates how to implement a simple Hartree-Fock program using MPQC. This example
demonstrates how to use MPQC integrals libraries, matrix package, and KeyVal library.

1) To compile this example you must have compiled MPQC and installed it using 'make install'
   commmand. This will install the code examples under $prefix/doc/share/mpqc-${version}/examples directory, where $prefix is the
   installation prefix provided to configure script during configuration of MPQC
   (the default is /usr/local/mpqc/$mpqcversion).
2) To compile the hf example simply type 'make', this will create an executable file called 'hf'. To run it simply type './hf'.
