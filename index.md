                                 MPQC 2.4

DESCRIPTION
===========

  MPQC computes the properties of molecules, ab initio, on a wide variety of
computer architectures.

  MPQC can compute closed shell and general restricted open shell
Hartree-Fock energies and gradients, density functional theory energies and
gradients, second order open shell perturbation theory (OPT2[2]) and
Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2) energies, and second order closed
shell Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) energies and gradients.
Closed shell energies using (ABS) MP2-R12 are also supported.  It also
includes an internal coordinate geometry optimizer.

  MPQC runs on Unix compatible workstations, symmetric multi-processors,
and parallel computers.
